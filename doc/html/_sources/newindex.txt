OfficeDissector is a parser library for static security analysis of
Office Open XML (OOXML) Documents, created by Grier Forensics for the
Cyber System Assessments Group at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory.

OfficeDissector is the first parser designed specifically for security
analysis of OOXML documents. It exposes all internals, including
document properties, parts, content-type, relationships, embedded macros
and multimedia, and comments, and more. It provides full JSON export,
and a MASTIFF based plugin architecture. It also includes a nearly 600
MB test corpus, unit tests with nearly 100% coverage, smoke tests
running against the entire corpus, and simple, well factored, fully
commented code.
